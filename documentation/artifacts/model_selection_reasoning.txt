Model Selection Reasoning:
--------------------------
The model 'XGBoost' (xgboost) was selected as the best model because:
1. Optimization Goal: Minimize 'val_loss' (defined as 1 - (0.5 * Recall + 0.5 * ROC_AUC))
   - This prioritizes models with high Recall (sensitivity) while maintaining good discrimination (AUC).
2. Validation Performance: It achieved the lowest validation loss of 0.1534
   - Validation Composite Score: 0.8466
3. Indicative Performance (Test Set):
   - Accuracy: 0.9016
   - Recall: 0.9016
   - ROC AUC: 0.9497
4. Constraints: The selection was made within a time budget of 60 seconds.
